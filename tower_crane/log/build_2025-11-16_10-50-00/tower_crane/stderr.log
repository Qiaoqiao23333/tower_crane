CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:13 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcanopen_core.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "canopen_core", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "canopen_core" with
  any of the following names:

    canopen_coreConfig.cmake
    canopen_core-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "canopen_core" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "canopen_core_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "canopen_core" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
